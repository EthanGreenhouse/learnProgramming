# learnMATLAB

Contains a collection of mini projects developed in MATLAB, showcasing numerical analysis, simulations, and data visualization.

## Projects:

1.  **Factorial Calculator:** Computes the factorial of a given number using both an iterative approach and MATLAB's built-in `factorial` function, comparing their results.
2.  **Bike Share Rounding Comparison:** Simulates the sharing of bikes between two locations, exploring and comparing the effects of different rounding methods (`round`, `ceil`, `floor`) on bike counts.
3.  **Temperature Change Simulation:** Predicts the cooling behavior of a hot drink placed in a refrigerator, utilizing Newton's Law of Cooling to model the temperature change over time.
4.  **Beach Nourishment Simulation:** Models the dynamic evolution of a beach profile over time, employing sediment transport equations to simulate beach nourishment strategies.
5.  **Ball Drop Experiment:** Compares experimental data collected from a ball drop experiment against theoretical predictions, analyzing the ball's height as a function of time.
6.  **Commute Variance Simulation:** Simulates and compares the variance in travel times for three different modes of transportation (bus, subway, and car) using random distributions to model delays and travel times.
7.  **March Madness Bracket Generator:** Simulates the NCAA March Madness basketball tournament, generating a bracket based on team statistics such as offensive efficiency, defensive efficiency, and win percentage in close games.
