# learnMATLAB

This repository contains a collection of mini projects developed in MATLAB, showcasing numerical analysis, simulations, and data visualization.

## Projects:

1. **Ball Drop Experiment**: Compares experimental and theoretical data for a ball drop experiment, analyzing height over time.
2. **Beach Nourishment Simulation**: Models the evolution of a beach profile over time using sediment transport equations.
3. **Bike Share Rounding Comparison**: Simulates bike sharing between two locations and compares rounding methods (`round`, `ceil`, `floor`) for bike counts.
4. **Temperature Change Simulation**: Predicts the cooling of a hot drink in a fridge using Newton's Law of Cooling.
5. **Factorial Calculator**: Computes the factorial of a number iteratively and compares it with MATLAB's built-in `factorial` function.
